            <p>Greetings! I am a frontend developer and design adopter with 5 years of commercial experience in CSS, HTML, Javascript and different CMS platforms.</p>
            <p>After I graduated as an economist in year 2011, I understood that reality is changing and had to train for a new profession. In this regard, a few years later, I decided that I should also become a programmer and successfully completed my studies at a local university. Education was terrible and only gave an approximate guideline, universities in the CIS do not provide the required amount of knowledge and as a result I had to learn everything myself, and want to continue doing that.</p>
            <p>Most of my career I have had freelance sideprojects, but also worked in different Moldavian companies as a frontend developer. Most of my tasks were around bringing design into code.</p>
            <p>What I consider most important in modern projects is ability to create a good design system with collaboration from all team members.</p>

          <div class="box--body">
            <p>This is how I can describe my set of skills around CSS in one sentence: a fan of responsive and crossbrowser code, with ability to do it pixel perfect, lover to read the <a class="link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2021/" target="_blank">specification</a> and walk around <a class="link" href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work.html" target="_blank">css modules</a>.</p>
            <p>Had experience with many popular CSS concepts like atomic or BEM and frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, but prefer to write everything from scratch and mix the ideas.</p>
            <p>Have touched all the popular preprocessors like SASS, SCSS, LESS, Stylus.</p>
            <p>Big experience in converting design from figma and similar tools into code.</p>
            <p>Had a lot of experience with CSS animations and transitions.</p>

          <div class="box--body">
            <p>Good HTML has to be semantic and SEO friendly, but I didn't find a person who is 100% sure how to do it. Not a big accessibility expert, but understand the importance of it.</p>
            <p>I am fan of a big russian community Webstandards, and participated a lot in their chats. Once, the owner and creator of this community said a joke that most HTML developers have a disease called "DIVatosis", and I don't want to be this kind of developer. But most of time business doesn't need other tags and don't have resources for e.g. accessibility, so I put design on the first place for myself.</p>

          <div class="box--body">
            <p>As frontend developer, I always faced with various tasks related to it. I even passed the exam with excellent marks, but would love someday to fully understand the prototype inheritance and why OOP in javascript is just a syntax sugar. I am aware of who is developing it and went deep into the specification a couple of times.</p>
            <p>I had experience with many modern frameworks like meteor.js, vue, react and ui kits that are used in their ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Have tried Javascript animations and libraries like Greensock. My first project was to transform Adobe Premiere video into a landing page that was fully animated.</p>
            <p>Had experience with tools like Typescript and Redux, but want to understand them better.</p>
            <p>My dream is to start creating cool animations with Canvas someday.</p>

Looking to the future, it seems that the world of nocode programming will only expand and such a set of knowledge will come in handy more than once.</p>

            <p>A wordpress theme that I was working on as a frontend developer for more than a year. Most of my experience I got from that times, because we had to build a constructor for other websites and when this is the case, the process of development is very different from traditional. It should be borne in mind that the person who bought the theme will definitely want to do something that was not planned. Because of this, there was a feeling that the development process takes forever. In addition, the WordPress ecosystem itself is not perfect, and most of time you have to go through different code styles of different plugins with many problems and limitations.</p>

            <h3>Music and design</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="box--body">
            <p>Before I started programming I was deeply immersed in the world of music, and even had experience with creating internet label and promoting music on different platforms. After several releases we decided to build a website for our label and it was listed on <a class="link" href="https://brutalistwebsites.com" target="_blank">https://brutalistwebsites.com</a>. Unfortunately it is not longer supported and is not available, but still on that list.</p>
            <p>This was an entry point for me. One of my friends decided to help with building a website and also decided to use meteor.js as a framework. At that time it was most cutting edge technology in the world of Javascript. After he had no time to continue supporting it, I had to do it by myself.</p>
            <p>I can’t say that I got used to it, but every post on a website blog was a custom html and css with a lot of experiments. I was doing it for about 5 years, and most of my knowledge and experience in css was because of this project</p>
            <p>Example of music we were releasing: <a class="link" href="https://bassfunk.bandcamp.com/album/life-death-ep" target="_blank">https://bassfunk.bandcamp.com/album/life-death-ep</a></p>
            <p>Example of design around which the site was build: <a class="link" href="https://i.imgur.com/MMaD2nC.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/MMaD2nC.png</a></p>
