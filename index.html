            <p>As frontend developer, I always faced with various tasks related to it. I even passed the exam with excellent marks, but would love someday to fully understand the prototype inheritance and why OOP in javascript is just a syntax sugar. I am aware of who is developing it and went deep into the specification a couple of times. Had experience with vue and react.</p>

            <p>This was an entry point for me. One of my friends decided to help with building a website for musical label and also decided to use meteor.js as a framework. After he had no time to continue supporting it, I had to do it by myself. I canâ€™t say that I really understood what was happening then, but it helped me to start navigating the frontend world</p>

            <p>A wordpress theme that I was working on as a frontend developer for more than a year. Most of my experience I got from that times, because we had to build a constructor for other websites and when this is the case, the process of development is very different from traditional. It should be borne in mind that the person who bought the theme will definitely want to do something that was not planned. Because of this, there was a feeling that the development process takes forever. In addition, the WordPress ecosystem itself is not perfect, and if you look under the cop, many fled in horror.</p>

            <p>To be honest, the webflow turned out to be the most pleasant site builder I have ever tried before. Still it is nocode programming and I can't be proud of it, but after this project I understood that no matter what the site builder is, it will be possible to quickly deal with it.</p>

            <p>Before I started programming I was deeply immersed in the world of music, and even had experience with creating internet label and promoting music on different platforms. After several releases we decided to build a website for our label and it was listed on https://brutalistwebsites.com/. Unfortunately it is not longer supported and is not available, but still on that list. Since than I started to dive into css and javascript</p>
            <p>I also have huge experience in photography, and look forward to continue this hobby in the future. For this reason, I am also quite familiar with adobe Photoshop and Premiere</p>
