I even passed the exam with excellent marks, but would love someday to fully understand the prototype inheritance and why OOP in javascript is just a syntax sugar. I am aware of who is developing it and went deep into the specification a couple of times. Had experience with vue and react.

                        p A wordpress theme that I was working on as a frontend developer for more than a year. Most of my experience I got from that times, because we had to build a constructor for other websites and when this is the case, the process of development is very different from traditional. It should be borne in mind that the person who bought the theme will definitely want to do something that was not planned. Because of this, there was a feeling that the development process takes forever. In addition, the WordPress ecosystem itself is not perfect, and if you look under the cop, many fled in horror.
